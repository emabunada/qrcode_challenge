### What I learned

During this learning experience, I discovered how to design a basic QR code display on a web page using HTML and CSS. I learned that QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can be scanned by smartphones and other devices to quickly access information or URLs. To create the display, I utilized an HTML container and inserted an image tag with the QR code image source. Using CSS, I applied basic styling to the container, setting margins, padding, background color, and a border to make it visually appealing. The image was adjusted to fit within the container without distortion. This simple design does not involve QR code generation or integration, but it provided a foundation for potential future explorations into more advanced QR code implementations.
